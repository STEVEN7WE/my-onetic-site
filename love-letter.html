        <p>
          <b>ALLOW ME</b> My love, From the very first moment our paths crossed,
          my world became brighter. You are the calm to my storms, the warmth in
          my cold days, and the smile I never want to lose. Having you is not a
          choice. It is my heartbeat. And if I had to live this life again, I
          would still choose you — in every lifetime. Forever yours, ❤️ and yeah
          Can't wait to see you and hug you for the very first time ....youre
          the best.
        </p>
